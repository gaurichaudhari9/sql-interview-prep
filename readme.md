## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of my SQL solutions and notes to help myself and possibly others enhance their SQL skills. Whether you are preparing for a job interview or just want to practice SQL, you'll find a variety of problems and solutions here.

## Formulae

### 1. Find even/odd stuff

> Note: When asked to find even or odd number of something -  we should keep in mind that we have to use **MODULUS operator**. There are two ways to use it - 
> - Use <code> WHERE (ID % 2) = 0 </code> </li>
> - Use <code> WHERE MOD (ID,2) = 0 </code> </li>

    
   That **,2** indicates modulus 2 and the **0** is the remainder.
